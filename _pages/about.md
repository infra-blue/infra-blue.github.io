## About me

<p align="left">I'm Leonardo, BSc. Computer Science Student @University of Catania. Born in 2002, passionate about binary security, web security, embedded systems and metal music. I began my journey in 2014, exploring the world of hacking and modding gaming consoles. In 2024, I participated in CyberChallengeIT, completing the program but deciding to forgo the official student spot. In 2025, I participated in CyberChallengeIT again, placing first in the local competition at University of Catania and participating in the national competition in Turin in July 2025.</p>
